# project.Amazon

Welcome to the Amazon Clone repository! This project is a front-end recreation of the Amazon website, designed to mimic its layout and styling using only HTML and CSS. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

HTML Structure: I started by building the basic structure of the website using HTML5. This includes the header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer.
CSS Styling: To replicate Amazon's styling, I used CSS3. I focused on layout design, colors, typography, and responsive elements to ensure the site looks and feels like Amazon.
Media Queries: Implemented media queries to ensure the website adapts to various screen sizes, providing a responsive design.
Flexbox and Grid: Utilized CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout management to create a flexible and consistent structure across different sections of the website.
